Adapter to sync tasks between [KADAI](https://github.com/kadai-io/kadai) and an external workflow
system, e.g. [Camunda BPM](https://camunda.com/).

## ðŸ§«Components

The Kadai Adapter repository consists of the Kadai adapter, sample connectors to Camunda and Kadai
as well as
an outbox REST-Service, and it's SpringBoot-Starter and listeners for Camunda. In addition to that
there are various
example and test modules.

The sample implementation of the camunda-system-connector uses
the [Transactional-Outbox-Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html).

## ðŸ”—The Adapter defines two SPIs

- **SystemConnector SPI** connects the adapter to an external system like e.g. Camunda.
- **KadaiConnector SPI** connects the adapter to kadai.

Both SPI implementations are loaded by the adapter at initialization time via the Java SPI
mechanism. They provide plug
points where custom code can be plugged in.\
Please note, that the term â€˜referenced taskâ€™ is used in this document to refer to tasks in the
external system that is
accessed via the SystemConnector

## ðŸ”ŽOverall Function

The adapter performs periodically the following tasks

* `retrieveNewReferencedTasksAndCreateCorrespondingKadaiTasks`
  * retrieve newly created referenced tasks via `SystemConnector::retrieveNewStartedReferencedTasks`
  * get the taskâ€™s variables via `SystemConnector::retrieveVariables`
  * map referenced task to KADAI task via `KadaiConnector::convertToKadaiTask`
  * create an associated KADAI task via `KadaiConnector::createKadaiTask`
  *	clean the corresponding create-event in the outbox via `SystemConnector::kadaiTasksHaveBeenCreatedForNewReferencedTasks`
* `retrieveFinishedReferencedTasksAndTerminateCorrespondingKadaiTasks`
  * retrieve finished referenced tasks via `SystemConnector::retrieveFinishedTasks`
  * terminate corresponding KADAI tasks via `KadaiConnector::terminateKadaiTask`
  * clean the corresponding complete/delete-event in the outbox via `SystemConnector::kadaiTasksHaveBeenCompletedForTerminatedReferencedTasks`
* `retrieveFinishedKadaiTasksAndCompleteCorrespondingReferencedTasks`
  * retrieve finished KADAI tasks via `KadaiConnector::retrieveCompletedKadaiTasksAsReferencedTasks`
  * complete the corresponding referenced tasks in the external system via `SystemConnector::completeReferencedTask`
  * change the CallbackState of the corresponding task in KADAI to completed via `KadaiConnector::changeReferencedTaskCallbackState`
* `retrieveClaimedKadaiTasksAndClaimCorrespondingReferencedTasks`
  * retrieve claimed KADAI tasks via `KadaiConnector::retrieveClaimedKadaiTasksAsReferencedTasks`
  * claim the corresponding referenced tasks in the external system via ``SystemConnector::claimReferencedTask``
  * change the CallbackState of the corresponding task in KADAI to claimed via `KadaiConnector::changeReferencedTaskCallbackState`
* `retrieveCancelledClaimKadaiTasksAndCancelClaimCorrespondingReferencedTasks`
  * retrieve cancel claimed KADAI tasks via `KadaiConnector::retrieveCancelledClaimKadaiTasksAsReferencedTasks`
  * cancel the claim of the corresponding referenced tasks in the external system via `SystemConnector::cancelClaimReferencedTask`
  * change the CallbackState of the corresponding task in KADAI to processing required via `KadaiConnector::changeReferencedTaskCallbackState`         

## ðŸ““Notes

1. **Variables** \
   When the adapter finds a referenced task for which a kadai task must be started, it checks the
   variables of the
   referenced task's process. If they are not already present due to retrieval from the outbox it
   will attempt to
   retrieve them from the referenced task's process.
   These variables are stored in the **custom attributes** of the corresponding kadai task in a
   HashMap with key **referenced_task_variables** and value of type String that contains the Json representation of
   the variables.
2. **Workbaskets** \
   The Adapter does not perform routing of tasks to workbaskets but instead relies on a SPI.
